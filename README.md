# 🧠 Sales Data Analysis – Case Study in Python

This project is a data analysis case study designed to demonstrate my practical skills in data processing, visualization, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python. The dataset was synthetically generated to simulate real-world sales data for 50 customers, 20 products, and 5 locations over a 6-month period.

> 🎯 This project combines knowledge gained from university coursework with self-directed learning.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `sales_data.csv` – Generated dataset with sales transactions
- `sales_analysis.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook containing all code and visualizations
- `README.md` – Project summary and explanation (this file)

## 📌 Objectives

The goal of this case study was to simulate and analyze sales data from scratch, using key Python libraries. The project walks through:

- Data simulation and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Aggregations and statistical summaries
- Visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Insights extraction and storytelling

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `random`, `datetime`
- **Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive coding and presentation

## 🔍 Key Insights & Visualizations

### ✅ Top-Selling Products
A bar chart visualizes the 10 most frequently sold products, showing which items drive the most sales.

### 📈 Sales Trends Over Time
A time-series line plot shows monthly transaction counts, along with a 3-month rolling average to smooth fluctuations.

### 👥 Most Active Customers
A ranked bar chart highlights the top 10 clients based on the number of unique transactions, potentially identifying VIP clients.

### 🗺️ Sales by City
A pie chart breaks down sales volume across five Polish cities, showing regional differences in activity.

## 📊 Sample Outputs

Here are a few example plots generated in the notebook:

- Product popularity (`barplot`)
- Monthly trend with moving average (`lineplot`)
- Customer activity (`barplot`)
- City distribution (`pie chart`)

*All plots are fully labeled, styled, and explained in the notebook.*
